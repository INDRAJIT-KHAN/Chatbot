#Chatbot Project

This project is a simple chatbot application designed to interact with users through predefined questions and answers. The chatbot responds to various user inputs by matching them against a set of predefined responses. If the user's input is recognized, the chatbot provides a corresponding reply; otherwise, it informs the user that it didn't understand the input.

The chatbot is implemented using HTML and JavaScript. It utilizes basic JavaScript object manipulation to handle user inputs and display responses. This project is an excellent example of how to create a simple interactive application and can serve as a foundation for more complex chatbot functionalities.
